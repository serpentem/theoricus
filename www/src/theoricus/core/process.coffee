StringUtil = require 'theoricus/utils/string_util'
View = require 'theoricus/mvc/view'

###*
  Responsible for executing the controller render action based on the {{#crossLink "Router"}}{{/crossLink}} information.
  @class Process
###
module.exports = class Process

  ###*
  Route controller instance.

  @property {Controller} controller
  ###
  controller: null

  ###*
  Route storing the information which will be used to render the view.
  
  @property {Route} route
  ###
  route: null

  ###*
  Stores the `@route` dependency url.
  
  @property {String} dependency
  ###
  dependency: null

  ###*
  Will set be true in the run method, right before the action execution, and set to false right after the action is executed. this way the navigate method on controller can abort the process prematurely as needed.
  
  @property {Boolean} is_in_the_middle_of_running_an_action
  ###
  is_in_the_middle_of_running_an_action: false

  ###*
  Stores the url parameters.

  @property {Object} params
  ###
  params: null

  ###*
  Switched to on when you run "@dont_render()" in your controller.

  This way process won't expect a view, neither wait for render time

  @property {Boolean} wont_render
  ###
  wont_render: off

  ###*
  Responsible for executing the controller render action based on the {{#crossLink "Router"}}{{/crossLink}} information.

  @param @route {Route} Route to be manipulated.
  @param @at {Route} Route dependency.
  @param @url {String} Current url state.
  @param @parent_process {Process}
