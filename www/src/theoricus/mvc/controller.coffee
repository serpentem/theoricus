###*
  MVC module
  @module mvc
###

Model = require 'theoricus/mvc/model'
View = require 'theoricus/mvc/view'
Fetcher = require 'theoricus/mvc/lib/fetcher'

###*
  The controller is responsible for rendering the view.

  It receives the URL params, to be used for Model instantiation.

  The controller actions are mapped with the URL states (routes) in the app `routes` file.

  @class Controller
###
module.exports = class Controller

  ###*
  Injected by {Process}, called after rendering procedure is finished,
  so {Processes} can go ahead and process the next pending one.

  @property {Function} done_rendering
  ###
  done_rendering: null

  ###*
    This function is executed by the Factory. It saves a `@the` reference inside the controller.

    @method _boot
    @param @the {Theoricus} Shortcut for app's instance
  ###
  _boot: ( @the ) -> @

  ###*
    Build a default action ( renders the view passing all model records as data) in case the controller doesn't have an action implemented for the current `process` call.

    @method _build_action
    @param process {Process} Current {{#crossLink "Process"}}{{/crossLink}} being executed.
  ###
  _build_action: ( process ) ->
    ( params, fn )=>
      controller_name = process.route.controller_name
      action_name = process.route.action_name

      model_name = controller_name.singularize()
      @the.factory.model model_name, null, (model)=>
        return unless model?

        view_folder = controller_name
        view_name   = action_name

        if model.all?
          @render "#{view_folder}/#{view_name}", model.all()
        else
          @render "#{view_folder}/#{view_name}"

  ###
  Renders to some view

  @param [String] path  Path to view on the app tree
  @param [String] data  data to be rendered on the template
  ###

  ###*
    Responsible for rendering the View.

    Usually, this method is executed in the controller action mapped with the `route`.
    
    @method render
    @param path {String} View's file path. 
    @param data {Object} Data to be passed to the view. 

    @example
        index:(id)-> # Controller action
            render "app/views/index", Model.first()
  ###
  render:( path, data )->
    @the.factory.view path, (view)=>
      return unless view?

      @process.view = view

      view.process  = @process
      view.after_in = @done_rendering

      if data instanceof Fetcher
        if data.loaded
          view._render data.records
        else
          data.onload = ( records ) =>
            view._render records
      else
        view._render data

  # ~> Shortcuts

  ###*
    Shortcut for application navigate.

    Navigate to the given URL.

    @method navigate
    @param url {String} URL to navigate to.
  ###
  navigate:( url )->

    # if redirect is called during the action execution, some operations must to
    # be performed in order to effectively kill the running process prematurely
    # before the router's navigation gets called
    # 
    # for this to work, your @render method must not be called, ie:
    # 
    # action:->
    #   if user_is_logged
    #     return @redirect '/signin'
    #   @render '/signedin'
    # 
    if @process.is_in_the_middle_of_running_an_action

      # kill current running process
      @process.processes.active_processes.pop()
      @process.processes.pending_processes = []

      # fires done_rendering prematurely so we can unlock
      @done_rendering()

    # and redirects user
    @the.processes.router.navigate url
